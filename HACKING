if you're hacking at ZBar, PLEASE send patches against the latest SVN!
if you haven't already, get ZBar from SVN by running:

    svn co https://zbar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zbar/trunk zbar
    cd zbar
    autoreconf --install

this will generate configure and all that other foo you usually get with
a release.  you will need to have some basic "developer tools" installed
in order for this to work (particularly GNU autotools)

when you're done hacking and want to make your patch, run:

    svn diff > hacked.patch

from the toplevel directory, and go post this file in the patches
section off the project page:

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=189236&atid=928517

finally, some interesting reading if you want to increase your chances
of patch acceptance:
