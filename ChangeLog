  * fix bug w/v4l1 not unlinking dequeued image
  * major restructuring for improved modularity
    NB not all changes are are backward compatible!
    - modular support for v4l2 falling back to v4l1
    - flexible support for more varied image formats (incomplete)
    - added reusable abstractions for: an "image" object and associated
      metadata, a "video" input object and a "window" output object
    - added new "processor" API to wrap everything together, simplifying
      trivial application usage (including zebracam and zebraimg)
    - removed deprecated "img_walker" interface, completely replaced by
      more integrated "image_scanner" (moving toward more image processing)
    - updated/added c++ APIs, including improved iterator interfaces
  * removed SDL dependency due to various usage incompatibilities
    (most notably the inability to embed video window into a widget)
  * cleaned up zebracam and zebraimg command line processing (bug #1838535)
  * many useful enhancements thanks to proposal by mhirsch45 (req #1759923)
    including:
    - v4l2 support
    - support for UYVY image format
    - zebracam cursor hiding
    - zebracam audio mute
    - command line video device specification,
  * significant error handling and debug improvements
  * some associated documentation updates
  * various new test programs (slowly working toward more formal test suite)
  * add missing xlink namespace to dbg_scan generated output (bug #1764188)
  * qualify char types as [un]signed to avoid non-portable C ambiguity
    - thanks to mhirsch45@users.sf.net and Colin Leroy for the patches!
      (bug #1759914)
  * add integrated 2D image scanning API
    - automatically ties to internal scanner and decoder
    - results reported via new symbol API
    - deprecated previous, cumbersome img_walker interface
    - uses new simpler/faster and denser grid pattern (FIXME add 45 and 135)
    - first step toward more sophisticated image processing
  * updated zebraimg to use new ImageScanner API
    - add initial decode location tracking
  * updated zebracam to use new img_scanner API
    - extended cache to track multiple symbols per-image
    - add initial decode location tracking
    - removed scan grid overlay
  * add configure check for ImageMagick version >= 6.3.0
  * configure dumps ImageMagick, SDL and firefox versions for debug
  * add NPAPI plugin stub and build infrastructure
  * flush zebracam output after each scanned symbol
  * integrate RPM packaging spec file - thanks to Vít Hrachový for the draft!
    (patch #1723536)
  * finally add HACKING to distribution/install (bug #1698202)
  * add extra documentation files to install (README NEWS INSTALL, etc)
  * Debian package patch for 0.2 - thanks to Vít Hrachový:
    - add libsdl1.2-dev as a build dependency
    - update automake (>= 1:1.10) as a build dependency
    - new package

version 0.2:
  * update distribution to include debian packaging
  * add consistency checking to zebracam
  * add redundant output suppression to zebraimg
  * fix couple of Code 128 decode table bugs
  * fix reversed Code 128 decode
  * add outstanding scanner edge flush to new_scan()
    - API change: scanner reset/new_scan() now return scan/decode status
    - update zebracam and zebraimg to call this between each walker pass
      (interface still needs improvement...)
    => improves in scan results for many cases
  * fix dbg_scan filename generation so results go in local directory
  * continue Code 128 refinement
    - finish character set C decode/expansion
    - add per-character validation
    - resolve scan direction in separate postprocessing pass before handling
      ASCII conversion
    - add several img_walker passes parallel to major axis (for long symbols)
    - add simple character set C example to test_decode
  * promote zebraimg images to TrueColor so colored scan pattern always shows
  * more dbg_scan tweaks
  * significant scanner improvements
    - changed "classic" [-1 0 1] first differential kernel to [-1 1]
      to improve minimum edge resolution to single pixel elements
      => still need to do some more research and validate assumptions
    - adaptive thresholding fixes
    - adjusted filtering for better edge detection
    - separate constants out to defines (FIXME add config API?)
  * fix EAN-13 secondary determinant decoding
  * dbg_scan tweaks to make annotations smaller/more usable
  * add get_color() interface to decoder
  * annotated zebraimg scan pattern for marginally useful high-level debug
  * random include cleanup
  * cleanup 64-bit compile warnings in zebraimg (bug #1712504)
  * add first-pass partial support for Code 128
    - separate out more EAN state from shared state
    - internal interface changes
    - finish dynamic buffer management
    - add shared resource locking
    - add Code 128 to test_decode program
    => still needs additional functionality and plenty of debug
    => reading both Code 128 *and* EAN still destabilized
  * add diagnostic program test_video to dump more verbose video debug
  * incorporate documentation into Debian package
    - thanks to Vít Hrachový for the patch!
  * fix VPATH doc builds (requires automake-1.10 and autoconf-2.61)
  * build and dist fixes
    - suppress documentation rebuilds in distributed sources
  * add Debian packaging sources - thanks to Vít Hrachový for the patch!
  * add DocBook template and build infrastructure
  * add manpages for zebracam and zebraimg
  * add GNU standard options to zebracam and zebraimg
  * internal decoder restructuring to support additional symbologies
    - separated out 1-D decoder infrastructure into generic internal API
    - moved EAN/UPC specific decoding into it's own module
  * fix confusing configure behavior which quietly avoided building
    targets with missing dependencies(?!)
    configure will now fail with a descriptive error message if you 
    do not have Magick++ and fail to specify --without-imagemagick or
    do not have SDL and fail to specify --without-sdl
  * add configure summary describing what will be built (req #1698196)
  * fix parity encoding in test_decode and add decoded symbol output
  * introduce Code 128 symbol type
  * increase width of zebra_symbol_type_t to 16 bits

  * add NEWS and ChangeLog
  * fix some config/build issues found on other boxes

    pattern

  * add decoder soft reset on partial mismatch
  * finish basic decoder symbol assembly/reporting
  * add decoder symbol checksum verification
  * add callback API option to decoder for "async" symbol processing
  * add "image walker" library API to trace scan pattern over 2D images
  * apply image walker to zebracam (C++/zebraimg scan pattern still TBD)
  * add audio feedback to zebracam (still has long latency)
  * add zebracam key cmd to dump frame to file (for debugging)
  * fixes for decoder/scanner reset/new_scan
  * fixes to scanner initialization and algorithm tweaks
  * made decoder less sensitive to violated quiet-zone
  * apply zebraimg workaround for imagemagick image display bug
  * add string names for symbol types to library and API to access them
  * add dbg_scan test program for visually debugging image scanner (and
    decoder)
  * add test_walk for basic image walker sanity/debug
  * removed recursive makes in favor of monolithic build
  * renamed some makefiles accordingly
  * finished some final symbol data construction
  * added result callbacks to decoder APIs for data reporting
  * zebraimg hooks into callback
  * zebracam still seems to "hang" in undecodeable state?
  * populate svn with current sources.
  * most of the basic functionality is included and working.
  * still need to combine final decode data, finish addons, etc (see TODO).
  * c++ wrappers are included and tested, but API may need tweaked.
  * zebraimg and zebracam basically working but need cleanup/polish.
  * need to create some basic documentation...
  * initial repository layout
