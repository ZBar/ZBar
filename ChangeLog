  * finish basic decoder symbol assembly/reporting
  * add decoder symbol checksum verification
  * add callback API option to decoder for "async" symbol processing
  * add "image walker" library API to trace scan pattern over 2D images
  * apply image walker to zebracam (C++/zebraimg scan pattern still TBD)

  * added result callbacks to decoder APIs for data reporting
  * zebraimg hooks into callback
  * zebracam still seems to "hang" in undecodeable state?
  * populate svn with current sources.
  * most of the basic functionality is included and working.
  * still need to combine final decode data, finish addons, etc (see TODO).
