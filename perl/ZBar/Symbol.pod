=head1 NAME

Barcode::ZBar::Symbol - bar code scan result object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my @symbols = $image->get_symbols();
    foreach my $sym (@symbols) {
        print("decoded: " . $sym->get_type() .
              ":" . $sym->get_data().
              "(" . $sym->get_count() . ")");
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Barcode::ZBar::Symbol objects are constant results returned for each
bar code scanned from images or video.  This object wraps the raw
symbol data with additional information about the decode (symbology,
confidence, location, etc)

=head1 REFERENCE

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item get_type()

The type of bar code "symbology" from which the data was decoded.

=item get_data()

The decoded data string.  Note that some symbologies can encode binary
data.

=item get_quality()

Confidence metric.  An unscaled integer value that indicates something
(intentionally unspecified) about the reliability of this result
relative to another.  Larger values are better than smaller values,
where "large" and "small" are application dependent.  Expect this
definition to become more specific as the metric is enhanced.

=item get_count()

Current cache count of the symbol.  This integer value provides
inter-scan reliability and redundancy information if enabled at the
Barcode::ZBar::ImageScanner.

=item get_orientation()

General orientation of decoded symbol.  This returns one of the
Barcode::ZBar::Orient constants, which provide a coarse, axis-aligned
indication of symbol orientation.

=item get_components()

Components of a composite result.  This yields an array of physical
component symbols that were combined to form a composite result.

=over 2

=item *

A negative value indicates that this result is still uncertain

=item *

A zero value indicates the first occurance of this result with high
confidence

=item *

A positive value indicates a duplicate scan
