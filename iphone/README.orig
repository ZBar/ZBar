ZBar iOS SDK
============

ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar
codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw
intensity sensors. It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, DataBar,
Code 128, Code 93, Code 39, Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.
These are the Objective C wrappers and integrated widget for developing
with the library on the iOS platform.

Check the ZBar project home page for the latest release, forums, etc.

Installation
------------

If you are migrating from a pre-SDK source version of the library,
first make sure you remove all of the old references to zbar.xcodeproj
and libzbar.a and revert any related build settings.

To add the SDK to an Xcode project:

   1. Drag ZBarSDK into your Xcode project.
   3. Add these system frameworks to your project:
      * AVFoundation.framework (weak)
      * CoreMedia.framework (weak)
      * CoreVideo.framework (weak)
      * QuartzCore.framework
      * libiconv.dylib

Documentation
-------------

See Documentation.html for complete SDK documentation.

Examples
--------

You should be able to open and build the examples directly from the
disk image (ignore warnings about the read-only volume).  If you have
problems with this, please copy the examples to your local drive
instead and build from there.

A tutorial that walks through installing and using the SDK is
available in the documentation.  The SDK disk image also contains the
resulting Xcode project at Examples/ReaderSample.

Examples/readertest demonstrates most of the configuration options
available for the reader.

Examples/TabReader shows how you can use Interface Builder to add the
reader as a tab in a UITabBarController.

Examples/EmbedReader shows how a ZBarReaderView may be embedded
directly in the application view hierarchy.
